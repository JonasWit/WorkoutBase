## Why WorkoutBase

- **Read it from across the room.** The countdown is large enough to follow from
  several meters away, so you do not have to pick up the phone mid-set.
- **Know the phase at a glance.** A progress ring and a session bar show where you
  are, while the flame background changes color and speed with each phase.
- **Hear and feel every change.** Sound and vibration mark the start of work, the
  end of a round, the half-way point and the end of the workout.
- **Keep training with the screen off.** A foreground service keeps the timer
  running, and the notification shows the time left.
- **Reuse your workouts.** Save up to 20 named configurations, load one in a tap,
  and back them all up to a single JSON file.
- **Keep your data.** No account, no login, no network permission — everything
  stays on the phone.

## The four screens

| Screen | What you do there |
| --- | --- |
| **Timer** | Start, pause, resume, reset or skip a phase, adjust the current phase by 15 seconds, and follow the round and session progress. |
| **Settings** | Set the rounds and the prepare, work and rest durations, choose the countdown and half-way cues, and toggle sound and vibration. |
| **Trainings** | Preview, load, edit or delete saved workouts, and export or import the JSON backup. |
| **Edit training** | Rename a saved workout and change its parameters. |

## Installation

1. Download `app-release.apk` from the
   [Releases](https://github.com/JonasWit/workoutbase/releases/latest) tab.
2. Open the file on your phone. If Android asks, allow installing from this source.

> **Updating from a build signed with a different key?** Android will refuse the
> update. Open `Trainings` → `EXPORT`, uninstall the old version, install the new
> one, then use `IMPORT` to restore your workouts.

## Your first workout

1. Open `Settings`, set the rounds and the prepare, work and rest durations, then save.
2. Go back to the timer and press **START**.
3. To keep this setup, open `Trainings`, press **SAVE CURRENT WORKOUT** and give it a name.

## Data and privacy

All data stays on the device. The app has no account, no login and no network
permission, so nothing is uploaded. Workouts are stored locally, and the only way to
move them is a manual export to a JSON file.
